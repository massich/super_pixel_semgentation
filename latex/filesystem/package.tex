%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images 
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX 
%  installations. 
\usepackage[]{graphicx}

% Clever cross referencing. Using cleverref, instead of writting 
% figure~\ref{...} or equation~\ref{...}, only \cref{...} is required.
% The package interprates the references and introduces the figure, fig.,
% equation, eq., etc keywords. \Cref forces first letter capital. 
\usepackage{cleveref}

% the newclude package is required
\usepackage{newclude}

\usepackage{acro}

% Managing TODOES and unfinished figures
\usepackage{todonotes}
