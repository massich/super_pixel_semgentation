### Structure
The primary file is called master.tex, and contains the bare essential and the abstract to get an idea of the content at a glance. The content is imported using include and input. Latex packages, acronyms, etc.. are called using input directly meanwhile the chapters (or sections) are called using include. If a chapter source requires from an external file, this is imported using input (in the further included chapter file).

The document structure is as follows
```
    .
    |____.gitattributes       % indicates git how to treat pdf and latex files
    |____.gitignore           % indicates git which files to ignore
    |____.git
    | |__ % Contains all the info regarding the repository
    |
    |____master.pdf           % document output
    |____master.tex           % document source
    |____README.md            % this document you are reading.
    |
    |____content
    | |   % This folder contains any file related with the content of the
    | |   % document. Each capter (or section) are stored in separated

    | |   % refering to the whole document such as frontmatter, acronyms
    | |   % and bibliography can be found directly in this content folder.

### Latex Packages
The cross indicates, that they have a usage example in this template.

* [ ] [biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) using a biber backend
* [x] graphicx
* [x] newclude
* [x] acro using marcos=true, which allow for \myTriger instead of \ac{myTriger}
* [x] hyperref
* [x] cleveref
* [x] lipsum


### Procedure
The master branch should be stay clean. Every conceptual increment (or todo item) should generate an issue. In order to address the issue a branch should be created and worked out. Once the issue is finished the master is checked out and the branch merged. If a issue needs to be reopen the issue is checked out, merged to master and reworked. Consider to open a new issue instead of reopening a previous one when possible.

### LaTeX Copmpilation

* Usual latex run

  ```
  latex master
  biber master
  latex master
  latex master
  ```

* Automated compilation with preview (my choice, using *latexmk* and *xelatex*)

  ```
  latexmk --xelatex -pvc --pdf master.tex
  ```

* [ ] Some compilation erros for the nested acronyms
* [ ] Place a snapshot of each template linking to its *branch*
* [ ] Task 1
* [ ] Task 2
