\section{Results} 
A lack of public data to perform fair comparison between methodologies using a common benchmark is a recurrent problem in medical imaging.
\ac{bus} imaging is no exception \cite{Cheng:2009p10580}. 
Therefore our framework can only be compared for the lesions segmentation case, and only against the results reported in the bibliography.

\Cref{fig:surveyResults} compares our segmentation strategy against the state-of-the-art methodologies assuming the following limitations:
(a) the other methodologies' performance has been collected from the literature. 
(b) Since all the segmentation results are reported using different metrics, those have been translated to \ac{aov} as a common evaluation metric.
(c) Evaluation datasets not only differ in image acquisition but also their sizes suffer a large variation. 

Each radius (a .. p) represents a methodology from the literature.
Those methodologies have been grouped in terms of \ac{ml}, \ac{acm}, other methodologies, and combinations of those three classes.
The figure reports the size of the dataset the authors have used for evaluation and also the \ac{aov} reported. 
Highlighted in blue there is also represented an experiment conduced by Pons et al.~\cite{gerard2013} where 50 \ac{bus} images with a single lesion were all delineated by 5 experts in order to study inter- and intra-observer variability of \ac{gt} annotation. 
The experiment reported an \ac{aov} rate between $0.8$ and $0.852$ for the 6 actors, when counting the original \ac{gt} accompanying the images.

Our segmentation results are represented as a black circle showing that those are within the state-of-the-art. 
A more meticulous analysis of the results is present in the complete version of the manuscript.
