\begin{abstract}
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer.
Medical imaging has become an indispensable tool for its prevention and treatment.
Due to several reasons, there is a growing interest in the medical community to incorporate \ac*{us} screening as part of the standard routine.
This leads to new developments in \ac*{cad} systems applied to breast cancer and \acs*{us} images.  
However, in order to produce proper diagnosis using computer systems, accurate delineations of the lesions and structures of the breast are essential.

This article proposes a highly modular and flexible framework for segmenting lesions and tissues present in \ac*{bus} images, which takes advantage of optimization strategy using super-pixels and high-level descriptors similar to the visual cues used by radiologists during diagnosis tasks.
Qualitative and quantitative results are provided stating a performance within the range of the state-of-the-art.
